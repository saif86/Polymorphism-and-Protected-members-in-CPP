How to use Polymorphism and protected data members in C++

## Problem Statement
Create a **Painting** class that holds the painting title, artist name, and value. All **Paintings** are valued at *$400* unless they are **FamousPaintings**. Include a display function that displays all fields. The **FamousPainting** subclass overrides the **Painting** value and sets each Paintingâ€™s value to *$25,000*.

Write a main( ) function that declares an array of 10 **Painting** objects. Prompt the user to enter the title and artist for each of the 10 **Paintings**. Consider the **Painting** to be a **FamousPainting** if the artist is one of the following: Degas, Monet, Picasso, or Rembrandt. Display the 10 **Paintings**.
